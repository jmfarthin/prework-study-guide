## Usage

This webpage can be used to review topics introduced during the bootcamp prework assignments. Each topic (HTML, CSS, Git, JavaScript) has their own notes that were taken during the course of completing the prework and can be used to learn some of the concepts of each topic. Navigating to the console by way of Chrome DevTools (press Command+Option+I (macOS) or Control+Shift+I (Windows)) shows the JavaScript in action and suggests a random topic to study first.
